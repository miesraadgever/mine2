  about: {
    paragraph1:
      "Started in 2020 as a fashion brand, called mi_ne (pronounced: /'mini'/), mies raadgever and neeltje de jong explored more than just clothing. From here developed mi_ne movement; an interdisciplinary collective.",
    paragraph2:
      "Within mi_ne movement, mies and neeltje explore themes such as duality, feminine rage, and bodily expression, among others. These themes are brought to form in projects ranging from audiovisual works to paintings, to texts, and back to clothing, both mystically and confrontationally.",
    paragraph3:
      "On our personal pages, you can find more about our individual projects;",
    miesParagraph1: "Mies works as a visual artist and designer.",
    miesParagraph2:
      "`Educated as a graphic designer, I began abstractly representing concepts. Gradually, my practice shifted more towards exploring the boundaries between digital and analog work.`",
    miesParagraph3:
      "By blending analog work with the possibilities of digital media, I tell the story in my handwriting. My work is figurative, but the message can be abstract. This allows room for individual interpretation. Each viewer can extract a different and personal message from the work.",
    miesParagraph4:
      "`I enjoy collaborating with others or working on commissions. Creating together is important to me. Bringing together multiple disciplines and perspectives results in a work that can be intriguing on multiple facets`",
    neeltjeParagraph1:
      "Neeltje works as an autonomous visual artist with a background in dance, textile, and fashion design. Her melancholic-poetic signature is recognizable in various forms of expression.",
    neeltjeParagraph2:
      "`My work revolves around movement. Movement of bodies, movement in ritual, movement through story. I learn deeply through the body rather than the mind. Repeatedly moving until it is deeply rooted in my being; an embodied practice.`",
    neeltjeParagraph3:
      "The stories that emerge from this, I translate into art surrounding and reflecting on the body. Where it all began. The aesthetics and tactility of my work are important to me because they translate the feeling of the story I want to convey. Video is a medium where I like to bring all aspects together; I feel it is the best way to capture and convey my stream of thoughts.",
    neeltjeParagraph4:
      "I enjoy telling stories. To express the mythical, the undefined, the vague, the incoherent, the amorphous, the raw, the sad, and the small.`",
